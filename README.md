# Hivemind project

Hivemind is a complete fullstack responsive social media app using the MERN stack.

You can sign in on the register page with complete validation, along with the functionality to upload a user image for your profile.
You can create posts with images and you can also see, share and like other people's posts and add them as your friend.

### Visit the website

Because this website is deployed on render (free, for portfolios) the back-end experiences a "booting up" delay. So you will need to click login a couple of times so the back-end gets "started" and then it will run smoothly.

## Front-end

For the front-end, the project uses React as the main framework, React Router for navigation through pages, Formik and yup for Forms and their validations, Redux toolkit with Persistent for state management and React Dropzone for image uploads.

## Back-end

For the back-end, it uses Node.js as runtime serving, Express.js as the main framework, mongoose for managing the MongoDB, JWT for authentication and multer for uploading files.
